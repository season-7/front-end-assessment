                <p>Backgrounds have a significant impact on the design of a website. They help create a site’s look and feel, establish groupings, and assign priority, and they have a considerable influence on a website’s usability. Within CSS, element backgrounds can be a solid color, an image, a gradient, or a combination of these. As we decide how to implement these backgrounds, we should keep in mind that every background contributes to the overall appearance of our website.
